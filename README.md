## Introduction
This is the Ball Aerospace COSMOS repository for the Avionics team of the [Sounding Rocket Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/cobra/ "CU Sounding Rocket Laboratory Website") at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This specific branch is for new members to get comfortable coding with COSMOS/cFS.

COSMOS is a ground station framework designed to be used with vehicles of any caliber from Satellite to Rockets to UAVs. The CU Sounding Rocket Laboratory uses this framework as the basis for the ground software that is one the receiving end of the CUSRL CFS Flight Software.

**NOTE: Development and Compilation of COSMOS can happen on any of the supported systems outlined by the [Ball Aerospace COSMOS documentation](https://cosmosrb.com "COSMOS")**

### Instructions for installing COSMOS

---

#### Installing via Docker (Mac OS)
1. Make sure you have **xquartz** by running xclock, it should pop up then exit xclock.
2. Install Docker Desktop from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
3. Clone the SRL_COSMOS Repository into your ~ folder
4. Open a terminal inside the ~/SRL_COSMOS directory delete the Gemfile.lock file
    A. use the command $rm -rf Gemfile.lock$
5. Then install the cosmos container, inside a terminal type $docker pull ballaerospace/cosmos$, then let it do itâ€™s thing
6. In xquartz, go to **Preferences -> Settings** and Check the *Allow Network Clients*, then restart **xquartz**
7. From this point on you have to do this *everytime* you want to start Cosmos
8. **MAKE SURE XQUARTZ IS STARTED**
9. Then in the terminal do $xhost + 127.0.0.1$
10. Then to start SRL COSMOS use the following command, $docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -e QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 -p 1234:1234/udp -p 1235:1235/udp -v ~/SRL_COSMOS:/cosmos ballaerospace/cosmos$
